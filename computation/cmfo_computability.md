# CMFO Computability Theory

## Definition

A CMFO machine is defined as:
- State: tensor in ℝ⁷
- Transition: continuous operator T₇
- Memory: persistent fractal field

## Comparison with Turing Machines

| Feature | Turing | Boolean Circuits | CMFO |
|------|------|------------------|------|
| Discrete | ✔ | ✔ | ✘ |
| Continuous | ✘ | ✘ | ✔ |
| Reversible | ✘ | ✘ | ✔ |
| Parallel | ✘ | Limited | ✔ |
| Energy-aware | ✘ | ✘ | ✔ |

## Theorem (CMFO Superset)

Every Turing-computable function can be embedded in CMFO,
but not every CMFO process is Turing-compressible.

## Implications

- Infinite precision computation
- Continuous learning without retraining
- No discrete halting problem
