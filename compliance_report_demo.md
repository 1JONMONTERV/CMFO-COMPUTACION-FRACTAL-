# CMFO Sovereign Compliance Report
**System**: CMFO-EDU-CORE (v1.0)
**Constitution**: Syllabus_Math_10_v2.json
**Date**: 2025-12-16T06:16:06.520281
**Status**: STRUCTURALLY COMPLIANT

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This system relies on **CMFO Structural Governance**. Compliance is not achieved through manual policy, but through strictly enforced geometric axioms.
* Total Actions Audited: 3
* Structurally Blocked: 2
* Cryptographically Locked: 3

## 2. ISO 27001 (Information Security) Mapping
| ISO Control | Requirement | CMFO Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A.9.4.1** | Information Access Restriction | Structural Sovereignty. Access is impossible without geometric alignment (Proof Object). Enforced by ActionGate. | **PASS** |
| **A.12.4.1** | Event Logging | Immutable Ledger. Every action generates an ActionReceipt chained via SHA-256 and locked Structurally. Non-repudiable. | **PASS** |
| **A.10.1.1** | Policy on the use of cryptographic controls | Fractal Encryption (CFE) + Audit Lock. Keys are derived from Ontological Structure, ensuring context-aware decryption. | **PASS** |

## 3. ISO 42001 (AI Management) Mapping
| ISO Control | Requirement | CMFO Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B.9.1** | AI System Transparency and Explainability | Causal Trazability. Every output includes a 'Proof Ref' linking it to the specific Syllabus Axiom. 100% Explainable by design. | **PASS** |
