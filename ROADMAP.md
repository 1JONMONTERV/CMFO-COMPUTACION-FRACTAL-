# CMFO Roadmap

## v1.0.0 – Initial Public Release (Current)

### Stable and Production-Ready
- **CMFO Core Algebra:** Full implementation of `T7Tensor` and fractal operators.
- **CLI Tooling:** `cmfo` command-line interface fully operational.
- **Fractal Tokenizer:** Universal tokenization without dictionary lookup.
- **Deterministic Inference:** Reproducible outputs on any hardware.
- **Documentation:** Scientific axioms, proofs, and limits fully documented.

### Experimental (Alpha)
- **Full LLM Replacement:** Bridge protocols for continuous semantic understanding are functional but experimental.
- **Zero-Gradient Training:** Learning algorithms based on resonance are in early validation.
- **Hardware Integration:** Preliminary support for generic GPU acceleration via NumPy/Cupy.

### Planned (Post-v1.0)
- **ASIC/FPGA Backend:** Native hardware descriptions (Verilog/VHDL) for CMFO chips.
- **Formal Verification:** Complete Coq/Lean proofs for the entire kernel.
- **Distributed Resonance:** Cluster-level computing without classic synchronization overhead.
