# CMFO Scope and Definitions

> **Definition:** CMFO (Continuous Modal Fractal Oscillation) is a deterministic computational system based on 7-dimensional fractal geometry, designed to replace discrete boolean logic with continuous resonance dynamics.

## What CMFO IS
- A **Formal Computational Model** grounded in fractal geometry ($\mathbb{R}^7$).
- A **Deterministic System** that produces exact, reproducible results.
- A **Library and Runtime** (`pip install cmfo`) for building fractal applications.
- A **Scientific Theory** with falsifiable axioms and limits.

## What CMFO is NOT
- **NOT a Standard LLM:** It is not a Transformer trained on internet text via backpropagation.
- **NOT a wrapper for PyTorch/TensorFlow:** It is a standalone mathematical kernel.
- **NOT Magic:** It does not solve uncomputable problems; it solves computable problems using a different substrate.

## Paradigm Comparison: Before vs After

| Feature | Classic Transformer (LLM) | CMFO Compute |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Substrate** | Random initialized weights | Structured Fractal Geometry ($\varphi$) |
| **Training** | Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) | Geometric Resonance / Calibration |
| **Inference** | Probabilistic (Next Token Prediction) | Deterministic (Attractor Convergence) |
| **Logic** | Approximate / Statistical | Continuous / Formal |
| **Explainability** | Black Box | Geometrically Traceable |
| **Energy** | High (Massive Training Cost) | Low (Structural Computation) |

This table represents the fundamental shift from *Statistical AI* to *Geometric AI*.
