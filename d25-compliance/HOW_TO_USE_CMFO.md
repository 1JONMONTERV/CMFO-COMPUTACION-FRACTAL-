# User Manual: How to Use CMFO Correctly

**Document ID**: CMFO-USER-001
**Target Audience**: General Public, Researchers, Students.

> **IMPORTANT**: CMFO is **not** a chatbot. It is a **Knowledge Validation System**.

## 1. Understanding CMFO
CMFO does not "chat". It arbitrates claims based on strict rules.

## 2. The 4-Layer Output
Every answer you see has 4 parts. Here is how to read them:

### Layer 1: The Domain Header (e.g., `🔬 Physics`)
*   **What it means**: The system has identified the context of your question.
*   **Tip**: If you asked a Physics question but see `🏛️ Theology`, verify your wording.

### Layer 2: The Contract (The Rules)
*   **What it means**: These are the criteria used to judge your question.
*   **Example**: In Physics, the contract requires "Empirical Evidence". In Math, "Formal Logic".

### Layer 3: The Content (The Answer)
*   This is the information itself.

### Layer 4: The Truth Label (The Limit)
*   `✅ VALIDATED`: Solid, proven, safe to use.
*   `⚠️ THEORETICAL`: Likely true, but allows for alternatives.
*   `📜 DOCTRINAL`: True within a belief system, not physically provisional.
*   `🧠 SPECULATIVE`: An interesting idea, but not proven.
*   `❌ INVALID`: Contains errors or contradictions.

## 3. Best Practices for Prompts

### Good Prompts
*   "Show the *mathematical proof* that primes are infinite." (Explicit Domain: Math)
*   "Explain the *theological concept* of Grace in Thomism." (Explicit Domain: Theology)
*   "What is the *empirical evidence* for Dark Matter?" (Explicit Domain: Physics)

### Bad Prompts
*   "Is God real?" (Ambiguous: Physics cannot answer; Theology answers doctrinally. CMFO will ask you to specify).
*   "Who is the best politician?" (Subjective: CMFO rejects this).
*   "Prove physically that angels exist." (Contamination: Trying to use Physics for Theology).

## 4. Reporting Issues
If you believe CMFO has mislabeled a verified truth as speculative, or vice-versa, please submit a **Formal Dispute** citing the structural proof and domain.
