# CMFO Epistemic Policy: Truth, Proof, and Opinion

**Document ID**: CMFO-POL-001
**Purpose**: To define the criteria for "Truth" within the CMFO ecosystem.

## 1. The Core Definition
> **Foundational Policy**: CMFO does not arbitrate truth by authority, popularity, publication venue, or consensus, but by demonstrability within a valid domain.

In CMFO, **Truth** is defined strictly and operationally:

$$ \text{Truth} := \text{Domain Consistency} + \text{Structural Demonstration} $$

It is **NOT** defined by:
*   Consensus (Voting).
*   Authority (Who said it).
*   Volume (How many times it appears online).
*   Novelty (How new it is).

## 2. Classification of Information

### 2.1 Validated Truth (`VALIDATED`)
A claim that:
1.  Identifies a valid domain.
2.  Provides a structural proof accepted by that domain's processor.
    *   *Math*: Logical proof steps.
    *   *Physics*: Empirical data + model fit.
    *   *Theology*: Coherence with declared axioms.

### 2.2 Speculation / Hypothesis (`SPECULATIVE`)
A claim that:
1.  Belongs to a valid domain.
2.  Lacks a complete proof, OR relies on a proof method not standard for that domain (e.g., "intuition" in Math).

### 2.3 Opinion / Subjective (`SUBJECTIVE`)
A claim that falls into domains excluded from CMFO's truth function (Aesthetics, Personal Preference). CMFO will acknowledge these but generally decline to validate them.

### 2.4 Invalid / Error (`INVALID`)
A claim that violates domain boundaries (Cross-Domain Contamination) or contains internal contradictions.

## 3. The Role of the Author
**Policy**: The Author is metadata, not a validation criterion.
*   CMFO validates the *content*, not the *creator*.
*   An anonymous proof that works is `VALIDATED`.
*   A Nobel laureate's undemonstrated claim is `SPECULATIVE`.

## 4. Handling Disagreement
When two valid sources disagree (e.g., two physical models):
*   CMFO checks if the domain allows plurality.
    *   *Physics*: Yes (Competing models).
    *   *Math*: No (Contradiction usually implies error).
*   If allowed, both are presented as `THEORETICAL_MODEL`.
