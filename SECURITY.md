## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this software is intended for **Critical Systems** (Aerospace/Defense), we take security reports with extreme seriousness.

**Do NOT open a public GitHub Issue.**

If you discover a vulnerability (e.g., Buffer Overflow in C-Core, Determinism Break, Side-Channel Leak), please report it directly to the Lead Architect:

*   **Email**: `jesuslocopor@gmail.com`
*   **Subject**: `[SECURITY] CMFO Vulnerability Report`

We pledge to acknowledge receipt within **24 hours** and provide a `CVE` identifier if confirmed.

### Bounty Program
We offer geometric bounties (Tensor7 Artifacts) for confirmed critical exploits in the `native/` core.
