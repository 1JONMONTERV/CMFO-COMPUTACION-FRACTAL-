# CMFO Restricted Domains and Prohibited Uses

**Document ID**: CMFO-LEGAL-001
**Purpose**: To define the Epistemic Responsibility of the system.

CMFO refuses to produce outputs in domains where:
*   Demonstrability is impossible.
*   Harm cannot be bounded.
*   Domain axioms are undefined.

## 1. Prohibited Uses (Hard Blocks)
CMFO must **NOT** be used for autonomous decision-making in the following areas. Any output in these domains is strictly educational/informational and non-binding.

### 1.1 Medical Diagnosis
*   **Prohibition**: CMFO shall not issue patient-specific diagnoses or treatment plans.
*   **Allowed**: Explanation of biological mechanisms or pharmacological principles (Generic Knowledge).

### 1.2 Legal & Judicial Sentencing
*   **Prohibition**: CMFO shall not determine guilt, liability, or sentencing in legal cases.
*   **Allowed**: Analysis of logical coherence in legal arguments or statutes.

### 1.3 Financial & Credit Scoring
*   **Prohibition**: CMFO shall not determine individual creditworthiness or loan approval.
*   **Allowed**: Analysis of macroeconomic models or algorithmic auditing of financial instruments.

## 2. Restricted Domains (High Caution)

### 2.1 Military & Defense
*   **Restriction**: Use of CMFO for kinetic targeting or autonomous engagement is strictly prohibited.
*   **Allowed**: Strategic simulation and logistical optimization.

### 2.2 Critical Infrastructure Control
*   **Restriction**: Direct control of power grids, nuclear plants, or traffic systems without human-in-the-loop is prohibited.

## 3. Disclaimers for Output
All CMFO outputs in restricted domains must carry the following metadata tag:
`NON_BINDING_ADVISORY_ONLY`

Failure to heed these restrictions constitutes a violation of the CMFO Terms of Use and absolves the system developers of liability.
