# CMFO v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Date:** December 13, 2025
**Tag:** `v1.0.0`
**Status:** Stable Production Release

## The Era of Geometric Computation

We are proud to announce the first stable release of **CMFO (Continuous Modal Fractal Oscillation)**, a new computational paradigm that replaces statistical approximation with geometric determinism.

## What's New
- **Core Kernel (Reliable):** The Python implementation of the `T7Tensor` algebra is now feature-complete and tested.
- **CLI (`cmfo`):** Installable command-line tool for immediate usage.
- **Cross-Language Verification:** Validated against C reference implementations.
- **Documentation:** Full scientific formalization (Axioms, Limits, Complexity).

## Key Features
1.  **Deterministic Inference:** No temperature, no random seed. Same input = Same output. Always.
2.  **Fractal Tokenization:** Processing data as continuous waves rather than discrete integers.
3.  **Low Energy:** Computational cost scales with fractal dimension, not parameter count massive scaling.

## Installation
```bash
pip install cmfo
```
